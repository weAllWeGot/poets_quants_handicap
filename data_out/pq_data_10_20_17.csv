740,2.89,Tier 2,,,,,,,"Sandy’s Analysis: “Harvard Business School takes pols, but usually from the White House or the Treasury Department, and those kids usually have stellar records at Ivies and superb schmoozing abilities. Your chances at other schools you note depend on what your actual role is in the state legislature, what state (is it a state in which the school is located?), and who can push buttons for you. If none of that, GMAT might neutralize GPA and with sharp execution on your applications, you stand a chance at several of these schools.”"

700,3.25,Tier 3,Engineering,,,Asian,18,,"Sandy’s Analysis: The dirty secret about military admissions to places like Harvard/Stanford/Wharton is that GPA is a key factor and that war stories don’t payoff as much as you think they should. Plus, lots of military applicants have shooting war stories these days as a result of ground deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The big payoffs for military applicants, as far as schools are concerned, is not work stories per se, but working with others, both enlisted personnel and locals. ‘Helping my troops get along with the tribal leaders and setting up a school for girls, etc.’ is a real solid HBS  (and other schools) essay."
620,3.0,Tier 3,,,,,,,"Sandy’s Analysis: Well, Captain, I like you. But like I said to the Naval officer above, your low GPA will be a deal breaker for Harvard, Stanford and Wharton, and powerful combat deployments do not, without more, change the balance. And I suggest you format your combat experiences with suggestions above, ie. working with natives, leading different groups in different ways."
670,3.3,Tier 3,,,,,,,"Sandy’s Analysis: Hmmmmmm. Deeply mixed bag here. A low undergrad GPA is, like the poor, always with us. The grad school GPA doesn’t entirely cure that because most schools know that grad school grades are mostly As and B+s. And your majors, journalism and communications, are not known to be ultra demanding in the grading department. Grad school grades could help if you took rock solid stuff like stats, micro econ, etc. But my guess is that did not happen."
740,3.2,Tier 3,,,,,,,"Sandy’s Analysis: First off, IIT grades do not translate fairly into GPA by some formulas. IIT kids really need to stress class standing, especially if you are in the top 10 percent of your class. Always report that along with your grades. Schools say they are aware of this, but who knows. Some schools just blindly follow the formulas of agencies, which claim to be specialists in translating international grades. Those places often strike me as the 300-pound ladies on the sex chat lines. Who knows who is whispering into Dee Leopold’s ear that your U.S. GPA is 3.5? A world expert or the next contestant on Slumdog Millionnaire?? To the extent anyone reading this has experience with those agencies, please post in. That is a worthy topic of discussion."
700,3.4,Tier 3,Economics,,,,,,"Sandy’s Analysis: I am assuming you are not a U.S. citizen? If so, for example Samoan, your chances as a minority go up, possibly a lot. For the n-tenth time, ‘minorities’ for B-school applications means U.S. citizens who are African-Americans, Alaskan natives, American Indians or Native Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/as, Chicano/as, and Pacific Islanders. If you are from some undeserved place but are not a U.S. citizen that is good. But the school is not boosting its official U.S. minority stats by taking you."
670,3.4,Tier 3,Economics,,,,,,"Sandy’s Analysis: This is not reading as an HBS admit. You’re just too low on the GMAT, GPA, and job status meters. For other schools, your career trajectory, goals and why you need the MBA must be carefully crafted."
720,3.8,Tier 3,Economics,,,Asian,26,,"Sandy’s Analysis: You are a good example of a guy with a lot of impressive stuff that weighs more in the real world than it does on planet admissions (which is sorta like the moon in some cases, with its own gravity field). A 3.8 GPA and a 720 GMAT are totally fine, as is quant background. Spending four years with a web startup is something schools will pay lip service to, but at bottom, they would prefer that you either worked for Google or founded Groupon, never got an MBA, and gave them a building in 30 years. There is not much in between. Ditto on your writing published in The New York Times. I am impressed but schools don’t care all that much since it does fit in their wheelhouse. (And the record of journos who do attend business school is mixed: they often write tell-alls which have been done already)."
