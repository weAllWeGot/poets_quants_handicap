,,,,,,,,,"Sandy’s Analysis: Your chances at Wharton are 50/50 given your okay GPA, your lowish GMAT (especially for them), and strong extracurriculars, plus the Google premium. Schools like kids who work at Google because so much case study and entrepreneurship revolves around Google issues. Plus, getting a job there is a coup because it’s so selective."
